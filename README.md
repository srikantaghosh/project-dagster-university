# Dagster DBT Project

This repository contains my completed implementation of the Dagster and dbt integration course from Dagster University.

Throughout this project, I have successfully covered the key objectives, including:
	•	Integrating a dbt project with Dagster.
	•	Loading dbt models as Dagster assets.
	•	Building dependencies between assets within Dagster.
	•	Preparing the project structure for production-grade deployment.

The code reflects a functional pipeline where dbt and Dagster work seamlessly together for data transformation and orchestration
